Functional Tests for The Triangle problem
=========================================

The goal of this application if generate boundary value based test cases and equivalence class test cases for the triangle problem. 

Triangle problem
----------------
"The triangle program takes three integers, a, b and c as input. These are taken to be the sides of the triangle. 

The output of the program can be either of: Equilateral Triangle, Isosceles Triangle, Scalene or "Not a Triangle".

If the sides of triangle are outside of the [1..200] interval, the output of the program is "Out of range".
